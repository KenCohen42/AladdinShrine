	  <h2>"DO YOU KNOW WHAT A.S.H.A.C. REPRESENTS?"</h2>
	  As members of Aladdin Shriners we all know our greatest humanitarian effort as
	  Shriners is our support of Shriners Hospitals for Children. We are indeed proud
	  of the 22 hospitals in North America that care for children with orthopedic
	  problems and those that have been seriously burned, but we also care for and
	  treat cleft lip and pallet deficiencies and spinal cord injuries and defects as
	  well.<br/><br/>

	  However, Aladdin Shriners have gone above and beyond in its humanitarian quest
	  to provide better lives for children. For the past 70 years Aladdin has been
	  treating children locally with those same problems right here in central Ohio
	  through a very special organization called The Aladdin Shriners Hospital
	  Association for Children, (A.S.H.A.C.) This association was established to
	  support Shriners Hospitals for Children throughout the world but to also care
	  for children in central Ohio - all the while spreading the message of the
	  benevolence of Shriners.<br/><br/>

	  This organization does not in any way compete with the 22 Shrine Hospitals -
	  but complements their endeavors. A.S.H.A.C. in collaboration with Shriners
	  International and Shriners Hospitals for Children maintains an operating fund
	  from which the interest and dividends from this fund provide the money to pay
	  for care and treatment of children in Aladdin’s jurisdiction suffering from
	  burn injuries, orthopedic problems, spinal cord injuries and cleft lip and
	  pallet deficiencies in addition to providing wheelchairs, prosthetics and
	  patient care support.<br/><br/>

	  At the end of each year after all the bills are paid A.S.H.A.C. takes the
	  remaining amount of money received from interest, dividends, wills, bequests
	  and outright donations in excess of the amount it is permitted to maintain in
	  the fund and disperses the money as follows: a minimum of one half is returned
	  to Shriners Hospitals for Children (by dividing the amount into thirds and
	  giving these thirds equally to the Lexington, Cincinnati and Erie Shrine
	  Hospitals). The remaining one half is then divided up and given to health
	  care institutions throughout Aladdin’s jurisdiction upon written request to
	  and approval from the trustees of A.S.H.A.C. that support patient care within
	  the guidelines set forth by the trustees of A.S.H.A.C. and Shriners Hospitals
	  for Children.<br/><br/>

	  The ability of Aladdin Shriners to be able to care for and treat children
	  within our own jurisdiction is unique and a source of pride for all Aladdin
	  Shriners without diminishing our efforts on behalf of Shriners Hospitals for
	  Children nationally.<br/><br/>

	  So, my fellow Nobles give yourselves a hearty pat on the back, you deserve it.<br/><br/>

	  Now -are Aladdin Shriners special? You bet.
