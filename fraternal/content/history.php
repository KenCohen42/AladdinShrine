	  <h2>History of Aladdin Shrine</h2>  
	  
	  The founding of the Shrine in Columbus, can be traced to Nobles R.R. Rickly and Clark 
	  D. Higgins, the first to receive the order in this city. Others afterwards received 
	  the order. They were all members of (our Mother Shrine) Syrian of Cincinnati, 
	  Ohio.<p>
	  
	  Noble R.R. Rickly issued a call for a meeting of the Nobles in Columbus to organize a 
	  club of Shriners and to reply to the said call, on the evening of December 7, 1887, 
	  the following Nobles met in the office of Capital City Bank with R.R. Rickly, Chairman 
	  and W.E. Joseph, Secretary, C.D. Higgins, R.M. Gilbert, W.E. Carpenter, JC Fenimore, 
	  Peter Sells, Harry Kauffman, Jno. P. McCune, C.S. Ammel, S.H. Barrett, E.N. Hatcher, 
	  Chas. Huston, F.E. Drake. The object of the meeting was stated by Noble Rickly, and 
	  Columbus club of Syrian Shrine, N.M.S. was organized, and the following officers of 
	  the club were elected: R.R. Rickly, President; C.D. Higgins, Vice President; W.E. 
	  Carpenter, Treasurer; W.E. Joseph, Secretary. "The object of this club shall be the 
	  cultivation of the social virtues of its members and thier families and the prevention 
	  of the intrusion of any profane unless they shall possess the qualities of head and 
	  heart which stamp them as gentlemen."<p>
	  
	  With the above object in view the interest of the Shrine grew from day to day. A 
	  great many very pleasant social events were indulged in by our club.<p>
	  
	  During the existence of the club the following officers served: R.R. Rickly, R.M. 
	  Gilbert, Henry Kauffman, Presidents: C.D. Higgins, Henry Kauffman, L.W. Buckmaster, 
	  Vice Presidents: W.E. Carpenter, Treasurer: W.E. Joseph, Secretary.<p>
	  
	  At a meeting of the club held May 9, 1893, it was unanimously agreed that the Nobles 
	  of Columbus ask for a dispensation for a new Shrine to be known as Aladdin Shrine, 
	  and at this meeting it was unanimously agreed that Noble Jno. P. McCune should be 
	  named as the Potentate under said dispensation.<p>
	  
	  Ninety-two Nobles petitioned the Imperial Council and at the Annual Session of 
	  said Council held June 14, 1893, a dispensation was granted.<p>
	  
	  On January 16, 1894, the first meeting of Aladdin Shrine under dispensation was held. 
	  At this meeting Noble Jno. P. McCune, Potentate, announced the appointment under said 
	  dispensation of the following officers: Jon. P. McCune, Potentate; G.H. Bargar, Chief 
	  Rabban; L.W. Buckmaster, Asst. Rabban; Edward Pagels, High Priest &amp; Prophet; C.M. 
	  Carter, Oriental Guide; W.F. Hoffman, Treasurer; W.E. Joseph, Recorder; H.W. 
	  Neereamer, 1st Ceremonial Master; C.D. Higgins, 2nd Ceremonial Master; F.C. 
	  McElroy, Marshal; R.F. Jones, Captain of the Guard; Wm. Morris, Outer Guard; R.R. 
	  Rickly, Director; L.F. Valentine, Assistant Director; Chas Huston, Alchemist.<p>

	  to arrange for quarters for the Shrine to meet in.<p>
	  
	  On motion, the fee for the order was to be $25.00 under the dispensation and the dues to
	  be $5.00 to July 1st 1894 and $5.00 per annum there after.<p>
	  
	  On motion the first class to be certified upon was limited to fifty persons.<p>

	  one hundred and ninety-two and four by affiliation, making a total of two hundred and 
	  eighty eight. That year one Noble demitted and two died, leaving a membership of two 
	  hundred and eighty-five.<p>

	   In 1923 the Imperial Council Session was held in Washington D.C. The President 
	   Warren G. Harding was a member of Aladdin Shrine also his Secretary George B. 
	   Christian, Jr.<p>
	   
	   One afternoon during the session the President and Mrs. Harding received the Nobility 
	   from all five Ohio Shrines in the grounds at the rear of the White House. During the 
	   afternoon Mrs. Harding called twice for Jack Richards, Aladdin's famous baritone to
	   sing.<p>
	   
	   Today Aladdin Shrine is the Second largest Shrine in North America and has membership 
	   totaling over 9,000.<p>
	   
	   In a most productive and progressive manner Aladdin Shrine, Scottish and York Rite
	   Bodies along with Lodges of F. &amp; A. M. shared the facilities of the Masonic 
	   Temple, 34 N. Fourth St., Columbus, Ohio for many years. On April 1, 1978 we moved 
	   into our new home, a beautiful Mosque comfortably located within sixty-two acres, 
	   a portion, of which is mature timber.<p>
	   
	   Aladdin is proud of the forty-six affiliated Shrine Clubs and seventeen Units, all 
	   active and productive in many ways. The first Unit organized in 1901 was "Aladdin 
	   Patrol". As membership grew and became apparent in an expanded geographical radius, 
	   much thought and planning was given toward organizing Shrine Clubs.<p>
	   
	   Our early clubs came into being during the period of 1910 through 1920. Indeed it 
	   is important to recognize and document the spirited support accruing to Aladdin 
	   Shrine through the efforts of these entities.<p>
	   
	   Aladdin's Circus has become one of the highlights concerning those functions and 
	   programs scheduled annually. After some years of not providing the circus program, 
	   it was revived in 1951. Each year one performance is devoted to underprivileged 
	   children of our community and jurisdiction. Hundreds of Nobles assist with care 
	   providing refreshments and maintaining safety on behalf of these guests. Their 
	   facial expression and spoken word tells you how wonderful it is to be a Shriner.<p>
	   
	   We have a beautiful Dining Room and a great Lounge in our Mosque currently serving 
	   the needs of Shrine Units and Clubs. The rooms are also available for service to 
	   non-members and friends. The auditorium is spacious and can accommodate dinner 
	   serving up to 1900 individuals. We are quite active in renting facilities with 
	   respect to business, civic and educational events. During the years we have 
	   occupied our new home, two Presidents of our United States, President Ford and 
	   Carter, have been a part of events being conducted within the Mosque portals.<p>
	   
	   President Ford, a member of Saladin Shrine in Grand Rapids, Michigan was presented 
	   an honorary Membership in Aladdin Shrine when he was here in 1981.<p>
	   
	   Aladdin's Nobility joins Shriners everywhere in expressing gratitude for past 
	   accomplishments and may our future continue happy and successful as our philanthropy 
	   provides healing and happiness to many.<p>

      <h2>History of the Shrine</h2>
	  
	  Two Masons in New York City founded the Shrine. William J. Florence, an actor, and 
	  Walter M. Fleming, a physician, talked about having an organization in which Masons 
	  could set aside the woes of the world and have a good time. During a visit to France, 
	  Florence attended a party given by the Arabian Council. He was so impressed with the 
	  pomp and color of the entertainment that upon his return to New York he gave Fleming 
	  a detailed account. Fleming, a 33rd Degree Mason and a Knight Templar, contrived the 
	  ritual for the new organization.<p>
	  
	  Florence, Fleming, and 11 Masonic friends met on June 16, 1872 to lay the groundwork 
	  for the Organization that would admit to membership only Knights Templar and 32nd 
	  Degree Scottish Rite Masons. On September 26, 1872, the 13 men assembled to formally 
	  organize Mecca Temple in New York City.<p>
	  
	  Membership in Mecca Temple grew and other Temples blossomed into being. By the time 
	  the Imperial Grand Council was formed in June, 1878, there were five additional 
	  Temples, including Al Koran Temple in Cleveland and Syrian Temple in Cincinnati.<p>

      <h2>ABOUT THE SHRINERS</h2>
	  The Ancient Arabic Order Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (A.A.O.N.M.S.) was founded in 1872 as a 
	  fun organization and has been called the playground of Masons. The Shrine, as the organization 
	  is informally known, remains such today, but, along with having fun, its Nobles have established 
	  the worlds greatest philanthropy. Today the Shrine owns and operates 19 orthopedic hospitals for 
	  crippled children and three burns institutes for burned children. Treatment at a Shriners Hospital 
	  is provided without regard to race, creed or color and is fully paid for by the Shrine. Nobles 
	  have provided treatment for more than a half-million children. <p>
	  
	  What might be called the serious side of the Shrine had its beginning in 1914 when the Imperial 
	  Council appointed a committee to consider establishing a tuberculosis sanitarium for afflicted 
	  children of Shriners. The proposal was rejected a year later, but it had set Shriners to thinking 
	  and planning. A proposal was made in 1919 for the Shrine to do something for friendless, orphaned 
	  and crippled children, and, after much planning, the first Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children 
	  opened in Shreveport, Louisiana in 1922. The growth and success of this great philanthropy has 
	  been possible by the efforts of Shriners throughout North America.<p>
	  
	  Having fun and caring for orthopedically challenged and burned children are two excellent reasons 
	  for being a Shriner and being proud of it.<p>
