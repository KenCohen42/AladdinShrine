It's a real honor to be elected as your Potentate for the year 2015.  As you know it is a seven year line and the last six years 
have flown by while Lady Glenda and I have traveled in Aladdin Land meeting with you at the club and unit functions.<p>

As many of you know I am a plumber by trade and have enjoyed having my own repair business since 1977.  Many of you have
kidded me about some of the nasty jobs that plumbers get into, and not that being Potentate will be a nasty job but it will be work.<p>

One of the concerns I have is some of us have stopped having as much fun as we use to have so I have adopted my theme to be PLUNGE
"N" FOR FUN.  Now we can all enjoy some of that daily, weekly and monthly plunging that is required to be active as Shriner's.  I 
would urge you to get active again if you have slowed down in your unit or club.  Let some of your personality shine through again 
and let the other Shriner's enjoy you and vise versa.<p>

Lady Glenda and I have discussed and planned a few activities for the year and look forward to seeing you at some of the events that 
are planned.  They will be in the Aladdin's Lamp.  I urge you to review and discuss with your lady and friends what functions you 
will be going to and get your reservations in early.<p>

RESERVATIONS…. Life is changing at Aladdin and with it is the requirement to R.S.V.P. for the many functions and dinners.  Please 
continue to help me with this as you have done in the past, and will be asked to do in the future.<p>

Let's PLUNGE "N" FOR FUN this year as we say goodbye to our old building and make our move to the new Shrine Center.<p>
