<h2>We Do It All For Kids!</h2>
It is an honor and a privilege to be elected the 108th Potentate of Aladdin Shrine.  My journey began in 2009 when Illustrious Sir Daniel E. Stainbrook II asked me to be one of his appointments.
<p> My theme is "We Do It All For Kids." It reflects our prromise to help the 
  children who need our assistance. We can accomplish this commitment by participating 
  in parades, Tabloid Day, Roadrunners and by being active in our Clubs, Units 
  and the Aladdin Shrine. 
<p>Membership continues to be a great concern. I have been informed that the Grand 
  Master of Ohio will have a one-day Masonic class in April where we will be permitted 
  to distribute Shrine information packets to prospective Nobles. The membership 
  chairman and I will be asking Nobles to man these sessions in the various districts. 
  We will have two Ceremonialss - in June and October - and my goal is to recruit 
  at least 150 new Nobles. 
<p>This year brings challenges and exciting opportunities for Aladdin. We must 
  find a place to relocate Aladdin Shrine and begin planning its design. I'll 
  be appointing two committees: the first charged with finding suitable relocation 
  sites and the second with surveying the nobility on design criteria.
<p>My lady Dixie and I have many fun, exciting events planned, including a Punta 
  Cana trip, weekend getaway on Macinac Island, Oshkosh Airventure and a Ladies' 
  Nashville/Grand Ole' Opry try; plus many familiar events you expect - The Santee 
  golf outing, Derby Day, Lake Erie Walleye Fishing and Chicken/Corn Roast. I 
  look forward to a great time with you in 2014!
