		<font size="4">ROOM RENTAL FEES &amp; TIME</font><br/><br/>
		Room rental feels vary depending on the size of room, type of event, and if it is on a week day
		or weekend.  A room is not officially booked until The Aladdin Shrine Event &amp; Conference 
		Center receives a signed contract and a deposit is made.  We are unable to hold rooms for any
		reason.<br/><br/>
		A deposit for half of the rental fee will be held and will be applied to the event.  The other half
		is due ten days prior to the event.  Any cancellation of the scheduled event will necessitate the 
		reimbursement of all expenses incurred by Aladdin Shrine Center in connection with the event.  Fifty 
		percent of the deposit will be refunded if the event is cancelled 90 days prior to the event. 
		Cancellations later than 90 days before the scheduled event will necessitate forfeiture of the deposit. <br/><br/>
		A 15% Service Charge will be added to the final bill.
